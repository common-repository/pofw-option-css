Adds custom CSS classes to product options of the "Product Options for WooCommerce" plugin.


== Description ==

This plugin requires [Simple Product Options for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-options-for-woocommerce/) plugin.

Allows to add custom CSS classes to product options. So you can apply specific style for certain product option or option value.
Also another plugin or custom JS script can find that specific product option by CSS class.

**Simple Code Idea:**

The idea of this plugin is to keep the base version as simple as possible.
And to add the new features as modifications.

This plugin has just 17 files to make it easy to use and customize. If you need more features check the modifications page [hottons.com/ocss_modifications](http://hottons.com/ocss_modifications)
